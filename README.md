This is my research project where we were predicting at risk students using Machine Learning Techniques.

Research Paper Abstract:
Predicting students success has been a very popular study across different fields and with this study we will be focusing on how Machine Learning can aid us in giving us insight in how students will perform in their exams. This paper will present a study on which Demographic, Academic and Behavioural features play a significant role in how a student performs in exams with an added feature which looks into the student's family background also. For the analysis of the features we will use the Mutual Information algorithm, alongside five machine learning models that which are a mixture of classification and regression classifiers. We will also use these models to predict our students performance. The five classifiers used in this study are as follows: Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour and Logistic Regression and we achieved prediction accuracy of 50.83\%, 81.67\%, 78.33\%, 75.00\% and 74.17\% respectively
